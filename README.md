## Python_Dice_Roller

Okay so I am giving you a freebie so you have an example of the kind of reflections that I want. I'll start you off with an example for dice_roller.py, then its up to you to start your reflections with the Python calculator and all subsequent assignments. You can delete this section from your personal readme. 

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Wiring

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was challenging because I had not coded in Python for several months. I learned that I could import parts of toolboxes without importing the entire thing, but that changes the syntax of how I call the function later. I also learned about using a while loop to control whether a user wants to exit the program. For the spicy version, I needed to use nested loops. Python determines what is inside a loop by the indent level of each line of text, rather than brackets like some other coding styles. That means I need to be really careful with my tabs!

## Python_Calculator
This assignment asked us to input two numbers and output the sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo.
